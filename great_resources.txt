Career / Tech

https://blog.xaviershay.com/articles/avoiding-project-cancellation.html

Xavier Shay's has an excellent blog I review oftetn - this is just a recent post I found helpful to understand high level decision-making and investment.

If your project is long running with back-loaded benefits (“pay off a year down the line”): you are a high risk project.

https://dev.to/baweaver/beyond-senior-progressive-influence-254g

Another great blog by a former colleague Brandon Weaver about career progression in tech at the Staff level and higher.

The big point of all of this is that influence is very much about using only as much power as is necessary to solve the problem at hand.

https://medium.com/@saumil/avoid-the-reorg-from-hell-with-six-key-principles-f8c9cbdfb0bd

Great overview of re-orgs and communication from Saumil Mehta, a GM at Square. Their article on compensation is also super insightful.

First off — any reorg will usually feature a very small group that is responsible for the actual design. A somewhat larger group may be consulted. A senior leader may be the final approver. And a much larger group would be usually informed. It is usually critical to communicate with each of these groups in order, bringing them in the know (ITK) at the right time.

Great article on promotions and reasons for rejections.

When working within a team, particularly a team staffed with more senior or a number of similarly senior individuals on the same problem, it’s hard to attribute impact across that team.

https://staffeng.com/guides/present-to-executives/

Great tips on presenting to executives. 

If you show up as resistant to feedback, then they'll start swallowing their comments, and you'll get relatively little out of the meeting.

Soft Skills

https://blog.xaviershay.com/articles/short-mantras-to-interrupt-imposter-syndrome.html

Great for anxious folks to gain some perspective.

If I’m not doing a good job, someone will tell me

https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/soft-skills-reading-list-a8af5a6296e5

Soft skills reading list - these books formed a lot of the foundation of my own (non-therapy) soft skill development in my career for communication, collaboration, etc.

Over the years, I’ve found myself returning to a core set of books that cover topics from communication and strategy to biases and leadership.

https://paulgraham.com/lesson.html

Great to come back to every now and then and a perspective on formal education.

But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system does to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the way to win is by hacking bad tests.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM

Excellent video about communication & how our education often frames difficulties in it.

You think writing is conveying your ideas to your readers, it's not….. It's changing their ideas.

https://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html

Great overview of why humans can struggle in larger organizations.

Most monkeys operate in troupes of 50 or so. But somebody slipped them a slightly larger brain and they estimated the ideal group or society for this particular animal was about 150. That brain, of course, was human.

Data Science

https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them

Excellent overview of the tradeoff between different DS specialties. 

Excellence in statistics: rigor.... Excellence in machine learning: performance.... Excellence in analytics: speed

https://towardsdatascience.com/the-analytics-hierarchy-of-needs-6d57d0e205e2

Excellent Article by a colleague Ryan Foley on the progression of data tasks available to do. He also wrote an excellent article on a 'money tree.'

The general idea of the analytics hierarchy of needs is that you should not move up the hierarchy until you’ve done the basics in the prior step (i.e. no deep analysis before metrics are defined & tracked, no dashboards built before you’ve started collecting & cleaning your data, etc).

https://developer.squareup.com/blog/product-analytics-at-square/

Great overview of Product Analytics (now Product Data Science) at Square by Fan Zhang (colleague)

With Square growing and its products expanding, developing, and launching, an analytics support gap emerged for our SaaS product teams. In their infancy, these new product teams needed to learn, iterate, and grow their reach. The SaaS products were not at the same scale as our payments business, which leveraged existing data infrastructure to automate decisions. Instead, product teams needed low-friction data access to make quick decisions. More importantly, they needed insightful analysis of seller behavior to drive product and marketing strategy. Addressing this gap was the catalyst for growing our Product Analytics discipline.

https://review.firstround.com/the-startup-founders-guide-to-hiring-a-data-scientist

Great article on companies hiring their first data scientist by Mengying Li. They also have a nice interview with the first data scientist at Notion

To gauge whether it’s the right time to bring your first data scientist onto your team, there are a few key points for reflection: First, has your company reached a point where you have enough data to generate quality insights? And second, do you have the right tools and support to realize the ROI from a data scientist’s insights?

https://medium.com/@selwyth/will-the-real-data-scientist-please-stand-up-1e6395d467ca

Great reminder to be authentic as a data scientist, written by a former colleague David Feng. Another great blog post by David on setting subscription prices.

Trusting the wrong data scientist can result in no-delivery at best, decisions made on incorrect assumptions with wrong interpretations at worst.

https://ianwhitestone.work/good-ds-bad-ds/

Great version of the Good/Bad PM article by Ben Horowitz.

Good DS is obsessed with solving business problems. They relentlessly search for them, and then bring out the right tool once found. Bad DS is obsessed with applying a specific technology or tool. They’ll orient their search for problems around the tool they are looking to use.

https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-is-data-engineering/

Great primer of distinguishing some different data terms and high level of the infrastructure.

In short, data engineers play an important role in creating core data infrastructure that allows for analysts and end-users to interact with data which is often locked up in operations systems.

https://medium.com/@gokulrajaram/the-second-most-important-metric-for-every-company-df958ff8c5ec

Great article by the legendary Gokul Rajaram (former exec I worked with at Square) - his linkedin, twitter, etc posts are usually very solid. Another great article on his SPADE framework for decision-making.

The second most important metric for every company is a check metric on the NSM. It’s a metric that constrains the NSM and ensures that the NSM grows in a way that is sustainable and creates long-term value.

https://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email

Solid overview of production ML guidelines, granted moreso for MLEs, but still has some great gems.

Rule #3: Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic

https://counterfactuals.co/case-studies

Nice new blog by a former colleague Tyler Hanson about end to end DS effectiveness.

The perceived bottleneck for these teams is not “insights”; it’s the manipulation and preparation of data. This is where the de-facto scope of a data team becomes clear: data analysts are on a separate team and defined by their technical skillsets in manipulating and accessing data, not their analytical prowess. When analysts partner with other teams, they are called upon to solve “data-shaped problems” rather than actually conduct data analysis, because the former is what actually separates them from the rest of the business.

Experimentation

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5506159/

Great overview of p-value correction techniques for multiple hypothesis testing.

Bonferroni adjustment has been well acknowledged to be much conservative especially when there are a large number of hypotheses being simultaneously tested and/or hypotheses are highly correlated.

https://booking.ai/how-booking-com-increases-the-power-of-online-experiments-with-cuped-995d186fff1d

Great overview of the CUPED method.

An experiment is underpowered when the treatment effect is too small relative to the metric’s variance for a given sample size.

https://blog.statsig.com/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments-cb0a69e09d3

Nice refresher of different overlapping test options / tradeoffs.

Even when numbers are skewed, they are in the same ballpark and result in the same decisions; overlapping experiments can be trusted to generate directionally accurate results.

https://bytepawn.com/five-ways-to-reduce-variance-in-ab-testing.html

Nice quick recap of reducing variance in AB testing with some nice visuals.

The rewards of lower variance in A/B testing are reaped in the long term, by having more accurate measurements, making better decisions and releasing better products more quickly.

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/experimentation-platform-exp/articles/deep-dive-into-variance-reduction/

Another great article on variance reduction.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6693672/

History of why we use 0.05 for p-values. Basically Z-score is ~2.

https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/04/29/berkeley-is-analyzing-sewage-data-to-track-covid-19-as-response-shifts-in-third-year-of-pandemic

Clever anecdotal story about using waste water to track Covid-19 after testing becomes less well-reported.

https://blog.analytics-toolkit.com/2017/case-non-inferiority-designs-ab-testing/

Good refresher on non-inferiority AB tests.

The choice of a noninferiority margin, also called an equivalence margin, is key. It must be done based on objective evaluation of the magnitude that can to be considered non-significant.

Coding Resources

https://pgexercises.com/

My go-to for someone who wants to get familiar with SQL or freshen up for a screen (besides hackerrank). Recursive, strings, and dates probably aren't really that necessary for a technical screen.

https://adventofcode.com/

Fun way to freshen up on any coding language (python github repo with some of my code practicing here). 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

Great datasets to work with and freshen up on ML / view notebooks, etc.

https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer

Best overview of many, many Stats/ML concepts on the web IMO.

Interesting perspective that's come up a lot in 2022 since ZIRP ended

Obviously, competence (and keeping your peers / leadership happy) is important for your career as well, but it does mean that your primary career driver is not to be the best at delivery. It's to be the best at growing your team. [when promos are based on HC]

https://www.brex.com/journal/the-enduring-value-of-funding-driven-fintech

Great overview of ZIRP ending on fintech by Michael Tannenbaum, and exec I worked with at SoFi. Also reminds me of how a lot of funding-driven tech companies often IPO to cash out/pay the team, when really an IPO was supposed to be about opening funding to the public.

However, as interest rates hovered near zero over the next decade and so much of my time was spent at SoFi (asset-based in the form of student loans, personal loans, mortgages) and Brex (fee-based in the form of charge cards and SaaS), I forgot the economic value of deposits!

https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/

Interesting view of the interplay of business and funding. 

The view of production capital is exemplified by Peter Drucker: 'Securities analysts believe that companies make money. Companies make shoes.'"
…
However, investors and operators are often deeply misaligned: investors think in bets, while operators think in consequences.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/17/netflix-has-created-a-self-fulfilling-cancelation-loop-with-its-new-shows/?sh=7dc05aa3784d

Interesting Forbes article that highlights what I would consider Netflix running up against 'Goodhart's law' ("when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure") - ie that targeting early viewership is resulting in shows getting cancelled early and creating a self-fulfilling loop.

The idea is that since you know that Netflix cancels so many shows after one or two seasons, ending them on cliffhangers and leaving their storylines unfinished, it's almost not worth investing in a show until it's already ended, and you know it's going to have a coherent ending and finished arc.

This website has gone way downhill, but this article changed my athletic career. Bret Contreras introduced me to hip thrusts, which is like the bench press but for your glutes. Side note: another exercise adage I've tried to remember wrt join health: motion is lotion.

Most experts don’t know shit about the glutes. Despite the fact that the gluteus maximus muscles are without a doubt the most important muscles in sports and the fact that strength coaches helped popularized “glute activation,” no one has a good understanding of glute training. Bodybuilders, powerlifters, and physical therapists think they do, but they don’t. In fact, the experts are so far off the mark that their best glute exercises can only activate half as many fibers as the glute exercises I’m about to show you.

Great example for the 'tolerance paradox' - that is:

Karl Popper describes the paradox as arising from the self-contradictory idea that, in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance.
