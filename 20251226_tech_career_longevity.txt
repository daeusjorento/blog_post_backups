Tech Career Longevity

I’m planning for a long tech career. I’m 12 years in so far. I might get lucky, or unlucky, and leave early, but financial independence is separate from career length if I’m still finding meaning. In the same way it’s wise to plan for a long life: if it ends earlier than expected, that stops being a planning problem.

For me, career longevity comes down to employability and authenticity. 

Employability is job marketability, the ability to reliably produce valuable work. Would I hire myself? Would others trust me with important work?

Authenticity is my ability to live in a way that feels true to myself.

In the short term, these often conflict. For example, should I work late on a project when I am tired? Navigating this requires being present with my actual state rather than acting purely from habit or fear. Am I a little sleepy, or genuinely depleted? It requires experience and knowing myself (often learned by having gone past my limits before).

I have noticed people struggle here and often outsource judgment to their environment. A coworker is working late, so they should too. Or, there are layoffs, so the work feels pointless anyway. These little decisions can add up to burnout or anxiety, instead of a more balanced flow state. It becomes easy to lose the forest for the trees and act impulsively rather than intentionally.

This tension becomes sharper when the environment itself is changing.

Career Longevity in a Changing Tech Landscape
I do not have a grand theory of AI, but I have noticed two reactions that seem unhelpful over the long run. Some people are trying to hold on for a few more years before exiting tech entirely. Others are convinced the bubble will pop and reset expectations. Neither stance offers much guidance for how to work today.

A lot of money has already been spent on AI. That alone buys it time, even if the hype cools. My working assumption is that things will continue to orient around products and customers, with AI showing up as a mix of product features, infrastructure, and increasingly capable tools that change how work gets done. In practice, the harder skill is not writing prompts, but deciding where AI meaningfully changes outcomes and where it does not.

Google did not eliminate IT work, but it made the ability to search well an essential skill. My expectation is something similar here: continued uneven adoption, real usefulness in some areas, and gradual normalization over time.

I also think broader macro uncertainty (inflation, interest rates, tariffs) is often being conflated with the effects of AI. The middle is thinning and low-accountability office roles are disappearing, but much of that seems driven by macroeconomics rather than AI alone (blog post). 

I don’t know how this will play out. Because of that, I do not want to optimize around predictions. What feels more durable is staying flexible: using new tools when they are helpful, setting them aside when they are not, and paying attention to real customer impact rather than narratives. Over long careers, usefulness compounds. That requires ongoing learning, some experimentation, and a willingness to let go of approaches that stop working.

When the terrain is uncertain, I find it helpful to look at domains where longevity is measured without mercy, and where outcomes are more visible.

A framework that helps me is to think of myself as a professional athlete. I am hired for my skills and expected to perform with a team. No one benefits if I get injured and sit on the sidelines. Performing at a high level over time requires care, not just effort. 

A Story of Athletic Longevity: Dara Torres
Dara Torres broke the 50m freestyle world record at age 15 in 1983 (only 7 years after goggles were first introduced at the Olympics). She became a three-time Olympian in 1984, 1988, and 1992, winning four medals (two gold), then retired at 25.

Seven years later, at 33, she came back. She qualified for the 2000 Olympics, won five medals (two gold), broke the American 50m freestyle record, and became the oldest medalist in Olympic swimming history. At the time, this was considered nearly impossible. Elite swimmers were widely believed to peak during college. After the 2000 Olympics, she retired again.

Six years later, at 39, she had a baby, then returned again. At 41, she qualified for the 2008 Olympics and won three silver medals, missing gold in the 50m freestyle by 0.01 seconds (the smallest recordable margin). She actually almost qualified for a sixth Olympics at 45 (getting 4th at the US Olympic trials where the top 2 qualify).

Now, this is not an endurance event or tactical sport. The 50m freestyle is an all-out contest of raw athletic power. Get across the pool faster than anyone else. It is an objective comparison across time, people, and geography. Age confers no advantage. In a discipline where swimmers were thought to peak around 19 to 22, Torres arguably peaked at 41, setting personal bests as a new mom.

How did she do it? Besides Olympic-level talent, her major innovation was prioritizing recovery over toughness. She turned an individual sport into a team effort, hiring a recovery staff of 6 (spending $100K/year in the 2000s), and spending hours per day getting physical therapy, massages, and stretching.

Contrast that with Mark Spitz, where there is a story that he would swim underwater until he passed out. For multiple sets. Take a second and imagine competing against him professionally. Imagine thinking you want it more and trying to actually beat him in a race. He won seven gold medals in the 1972 Olympics (all world records). Then he retired at 22. Imagine him trying to make a comeback at 30 if that level of training is what was expected.

Torres changed what athletes believed was possible in a new way. Innovative recovery-focused training likely extended the peak careers of many who followed. Her legacy is the realization that reaching full potential can take decades. I believe many Olympic-level athletes would have retired much sooner had she not made her two comebacks.

Anthony Ervin is one example. He won Olympic gold at 19, retired at 22, then returned years later to win gold again at 35 in the 2016 Olympics (making him the oldest individual Olympic gold medal winner in swimming at 35, taking the record from Michael Phelps).

Torres did more than make a comeback. She created a blueprint.

Work, Purpose, and Boundaries
Tech careers still involve sprinting sometimes. Late nights, tight deadlines, intense learning periods. Avoiding stress entirely is not possible nor desirable. Avoidance feeds anxiety. Running from challenges does not make an easy life, internally. What really matters is purpose.

Working late to hit an important milestone or learn a new tool feels different from working late to signal commitment. Good teams care about outputs, not time spent in a chair. What burns me out fastest is expending energy on work with no real customer or company value, or working for people who do not care whether I succeed.

This applies to non-urgent work as well. Focusing on the big rocks is key. Money can motivate compliance, but purpose motivates engagement. I dislike bad products and customer experiences, so I find meaning in trying to reduce that pain from the other side. In large organizations, connecting work to impact can take more effort. That effort is part of staying engaged. Having a ‘why’ can make many things much more bearable.

Meaning is my primary motivator, though learning and autonomy help (see Dan Pink’s Ted talk on motivation). I want a mindset that if I had one month left in my career, I would still want to learn something new to make myself better. That is healthier than the alternative of asking what the point is.

Some people chose tech or finance initially for the money. That’s very understandable. One thing I ask myself to see if I actually want to be here: what would I do for work if everything paid the same? Honestly, probably product data science. I might not work as many hours, but I’ve grown to love what I do.

That all being said, the environment really matters here. If a workplace is persistently toxic, I start planning an exit. Toxicity adds weight to everything and accelerates burnout. If I am stuck, I narrow my focus to what matters most to me, namely what my job enables in my life, my colleagues, and learning. I have to let things I cannot control go, and even in some situations use methods that work with toxic relationships like grey rocking. There are many reasons people might stay in a bad work environment and each person has their own cost-benefit analysis to make. Longevity comes from choosing battles consciously.

Personal Recovery and Sustainability
If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together
– African Proverb

Long careers depend on mental and physical health. My body is more truthful than my mind, which is more prone to distortion under stress. Ignoring those signs is one of the fastest ways I know to burn out.

One lesson I take directly from Dara Torres is that recovery is not a solo activity. Relationships outside of work create perspective and absorb stress. They pull me out of the day-to-day trenches and remind me that work is part of a larger life. When everything meaningful runs through my job, pressure compounds quickly.

Over time, I have learned that my needs are simpler than I tend to assume. When I am tired, hungry, or overstimulated, my judgment degrades. I set weaker boundaries and default to people-pleasing or avoidance. Longevity requires thinking about the next season, not just the current sprint. It is hard to get back on a good wave once I’ve fallen off, and doing so requires deliberately resetting my energy, attention, and priorities, rather than expecting things to naturally return to normal.

I try to pay attention to a small set of reliable signals rather than an exhaustive routine. Sleep is the clearest one. Staying up past a certain point usually means something is overloaded. A short walk helps reset my attention when I am stuck. Breaks matter more than I expect, because work has no built-in resets and burnout narrows my capacity to see alternatives.

Recovery also includes protecting my attention. Scrolling is not restorative for me, especially since algorithms tend to reward outrage more than joy. Writing things down on paper helps externalize problems and creates a clearer sense of what to do next. There is something grounding about physically crossing items off a list.

Play matters too. Video games with light social connection give me access to flow without tying my identity to performance.

I have also meditated 10 to 20 minutes a day for over a decade. For me, it creates space to notice when my mind is spinning and gives it room to settle. Even simple awareness tends to re-anchor the rest of my day. It feels less like self-improvement and more like creating space.

I think of therapy and close relationships as part of my recovery team, similar to how Torres treated recovery as a team sport. No one performs well for decades without support. Trying to do everything alone usually shows up later as anxiety, compulsive behavior, or disengagement.

When my identity narrows too much around work, I become fragile and more vulnerable to compulsive behaviors. Recovery, in many forms, keeps that from happening. Over time, learning what actually stabilizes my nervous system has been one of the most productive skills I have developed.

Recap
Career longevity is less about pushing harder and more about avoiding predictable unhappiness traps. It comes from staying present, protecting recovery, and aligning effort with meaning. Everyone’s balance looks different. This is mine.

The lesson I take from Dara Torres is simple. Sustainable excellence comes from staying in the game long enough to reach your real peak.
